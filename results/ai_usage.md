# AI Usage Declaration

AI tools (ChatGPT) were used to:
- Generate initial code skeletons for data generation, model architecture, and training loops.
- Assist in debugging runtime and filesystem errors.
- Improve clarity and structure of documentation.

All AI-generated content was manually reviewed, tested, and validated by:
- Running unit tests and training experiments.
- Verifying physical constraints of reconstructed density matrices.
- Cross-checking mathematical definitions with standard quantum information literature.

No AI-generated results were used without human verification.
